## What I Learnt:

### Setting up Client - Server Architecture:

- This is my first time working on a full-stack application in React and Node.js.
  I guess I can call my self a full-stack developer now (jk). ðŸ˜Ž

- I found [this](https://codedamn.com/news/reactjs/how-to-connect-react-with-node-js#project_setup)
  article to be a simple and helpful introduction to integrating the client and
  server side of an application and transferring data between the frontend and backend.

## Further Study:

- Below are subjects and concepts that I have added to my learning list after
  working on this project. I have also included some introductory resources:
